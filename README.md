# Not-an-UltraWide-Tool
### nUWt (not an ultrawide tool) is a tool to 16:9-fy your games etc; meant for ultrawide users.

#### Dependencies:
windows 10 (only tested one, might work on 7 / 11)

python3.8+
##### python modules:
   - tkinter

   - pygetwindow

   -  ctypes

   - sys


#### Notes
As this is in very early development I haven't made awfully customizable, nor added a help any where in the app so I'll add it here:

How to select an item:

    Click on the item or use the arrows keys to navigate to it.
    
How to 16:9-fy / how to undo it:

    Navigate to it, and press enter to 16:9-fy it, or backspace to undo it
