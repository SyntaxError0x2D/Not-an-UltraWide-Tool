# Not-an-UltraWide-Tool
### nUWt (not an ultrawide tool) is a tool to 16:9-fy your games etc; meant for ultrawide users.

## What? how? when?
I've had a issue with some games (mainly souls) not supporting ultrawide resolutions, so I decided to create a tool to help make the expirience a bit more bearable.
So what does this do? It allows you to remove the top bar of a chosen windowed application, and move it anywhere you want to. So the main use case for me is to move the game to the left quadrent 
leaving the rest of the screen free for a music player etc.

### Dependencies:
windows 10 (only tested one, might work on 7 / 11)

python3.8+
##### python modules:
   - tkinter

   - pygetwindow

   -  ctypes

   - sys


#### Notes
As this is in very early development I haven't made awfully customizable, nor added a help any where in the app so I'll add it here:

How to select an item:

    Click on the item or use the arrows keys to navigate to it.
    
How to 16:9-fy / how to undo it:

    Navigate to it, and press enter to 16:9-fy it, or backspace to undo it

Does this work with all games?

    No :(
